# Sales analysis 
## General info 
The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. I analyzed them with pandas and matplotlib. I used apriori algorithm to find products to recommend. I found answers to question like best sellers, best month, city with best sales, most common products and more.
